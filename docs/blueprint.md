## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft green (#A7D1AB) to evoke calmness and growth, aligning with the habit-breaking process. Derived from concepts of calm and healing.
- Background color: Light, desaturated green (#E8F5E9), which provides a gentle backdrop that isn't too visually demanding.
- Accent color: Light Yellow (#E3E18B), which can be used for buttons and highlights, contrasting the primary without causing visual strain.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear, modern readability.
- Simple, clean icons to represent the different functionalities like timer, logging, and history.  Use green as the main color, perhaps against a white 'card' shape in the background.
- Clean, straightforward layout with clear hierarchy; the timer is prominently displayed at the top, followed by the logging button and history section.
- Subtle transitions and animations on timer updates and logging to provide smooth feedback without being distracting.
